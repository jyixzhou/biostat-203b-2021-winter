## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

**Solution**: Of the three methods, `read.csv` from base R is the slowest and `fread` from the data.table package is the fastest. 
```{r}
#system.time(read.csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/core/admissions.csv.gz')))
#the above line is commented out to shorten the knitting time
system.time(read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/core/admissions.csv.gz')))
system.time(fread(str_c(mimic_path, '/core/admissions.csv.gz')))
```

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

**Solution**:
First, read in the `icustays.csv.gz` data. 
```{r}
icustays_data <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/icu/icustays.csv.gz'))
head(icustays_data)
```
- There are 69619 unique `stay_id`.
```{r}
icustays_data %>% 
  distinct(stay_id) %>% 
  nrow()
```

- There are 50048 unique `subject_id`. 
```{r}
icustays_data %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()
```

- The distribution of the length of ICU stay, `los`, is skewed to the right. There are several outliers with extremely large values. The mean is 3.9805 and the median is 2.0611. 
```{r}
ggplot(icustays_data, aes(los)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
summary(icustays_data$los)
```

- first ICU unit
```{r}
# ggplot(icustays_data, aes(first_careunit)) +
#   geom_bar() + 
#   coord_flip()

ggplot(icustays_data, 
       aes(x=reorder(first_careunit, first_careunit, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("First Care Unit")
```

- last ICU unit 
```{r}
ggplot(icustays_data, 
       aes(x=reorder(last_careunit, last_careunit, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Last Care Unit")
```

## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 

**Solution**:
First, read in the `admissions.csv.gz` data. 
```{r}
adm_data <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/core/admissions.csv.gz'))
#head(adm_data)
```
- admission year: The number of admissions increases from ~2110 to ~2130. Then there are a consistent number of admissions from ~2130 to ~2190. The number of admissions decreases drastically after ~2190. 
```{r admission year}
adm_data$adm_year <- ymd_hms(adm_data$admittime) %>% year() 
ggplot(adm_data, aes(x = adm_year)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- admission month: There are a consistent number of admissions over the 12 months. 
```{r admission month}
adm_data$adm_month <- ymd_hms(adm_data$admittime) %>% month() 
ggplot(adm_data, aes(x = adm_month)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- admission month day: There are a consistent number of admissions over the first 30 days of the month. There are fewer admissions on Day 31 because not all months have the 31th day. 
```{r admmission month day}
adm_data$adm_month_day <- ymd_hms(adm_data$admittime) %>% mday() 
ggplot(adm_data, aes(x = adm_month_day)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- admission week day: There are a consistent number of admissions over the 7 days of the week. 
```{r admission week day}
adm_data$adm_weekday <- ymd_hms(adm_data$admittime) %>% wday() 
ggplot(adm_data, aes(x = adm_weekday)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- admission hour: The number of admissions is the highest at 12AM. From 12 AM, the number quickly decreases until 7 AM, where there is a peak of admissions. The number then slowly increases until around 5 PM, and stays high with minor decreases until the end of the day. 
```{r admission hour}
adm_data$adm_hour <- ymd_hms(adm_data$admittime) %>% hour() 
ggplot(adm_data, aes(x = adm_hour)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- number of deaths in each year: The number of deaths in each year increases from ~2110 to ~2130, and then stays consistent until ~2190, when it starts to decrease drastically. 
```{r number of death by year}
adm_data$death <- !is.na(adm_data$deathtime)
adm_data %>% 
  group_by(adm_year) %>% 
  summarise(death_count = sum(death)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(adm_year, death_count)) +
  geom_col()
```

- admission type
```{r admission type}
ggplot(adm_data, 
       aes(x=reorder(admission_type, admission_type, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Admission Type")
```

- number of admissions per patient: the number of admissions for each patient is mostly below 20, while some patients have very large numbers of admissions. 
```{r number of admissions per patient}
adm_data %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  summarise(adm_count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(adm_count)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

- admission location
```{r admission location}
ggplot(adm_data, 
       aes(x=reorder(admission_location, admission_location, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Admission Location")
```

- discharge location  
```{r discharge location}
ggplot(adm_data, 
       aes(x=reorder(discharge_location, discharge_location, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Discharge Location")
```

- insurance  
```{r insurance}
adm_data %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(insurance)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()

```

- language  
```{r language}
adm_data %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(language)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

- marital status 
```{r marital status}
adm_data %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(marital_status, marital_status, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Marital Status")
```

- ethnicity  
```{r ethnicity}
adm_data %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(ethnicity, ethnicity, function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Ethnicity")
```

- death ????? 

## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)

**Solution**:
First, read in the `patients.csv.gz` data. 
```{r}
patients_data <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/core/patients.csv.gz'))
head(patients_data)
```
```{r gender}
table(patients_data$gender)
ggplot(patients_data, aes(gender)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

For the anchor age variable, there are a large number of subjects with the anchor age of 0. There are no subjects with the anchor age of 1 to ~15. There is a small peak of subjects with the anchor age of 91. 
```{r anchor age}
summary(patients_data$anchor_age)
ggplot(patients_data, aes(anchor_age)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, hematocrit, white blood cell count, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and lactate. Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

**Solution**:
First, read in the `labevents.csv.gz` and `d_labitems.csv.gz` data. 
```{r}
d_labitems_data <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz'))
head(d_labitems_data)

#labevents_data <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path, '/hosp/labevents.csv.gz'), n_max = 10)
#head(labevents_data)
```

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission
