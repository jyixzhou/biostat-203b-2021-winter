## Q1. Missing data

Through the Shiny app developed in HW3, we observe abundant missing values in the MIMIC-IV ICU cohort we created. In this question, we use multiple imputation to obtain a data set without missing values.

0. Read following tutorials on the R package miceRanger for imputation: <https://github.com/farrellday/miceRanger>, <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miceRanger/vignettes/miceAlgorithm.html>.

    A more thorough book treatment of the practical imputation strategies is the book [*_Flexible Imputation of Missing Data_*](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/) by Stef van Buuren. 

1. Explain the jargon MCAR, MAR, and MNAR.

**Solution**: MCAR refers to data being Missing Completely At Random, which suggests that the causes of missing data are unrelated to the data itself. MAR refers to data being Missing At Random, which suggests that the probability of having missing data is the same within groups defined by the observed data, and might be different between groups. MNAR refers to data being Missing Not At Random, which suggests that the probability of having missing data varies for reasons that are unknown. 

2. Explain in a couple of sentences how the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) work.

**Solution**: For a dataset with p variables, replace the missing values for each variable with placeholders, e.g. mean of the not missing observations for each variable. Set the placeholders of one of these variables back to missing, and use this variable as the dependent variable in a regression model and all the other variables as predictors. Use this model to predict and replace missing values for this variable. Repeat this process for all the variables, and the repeat the whole process for several cycles. 

3. Perform a data quality check of the ICU stays data. Discard variables with substantial missingness, say >5000 `NA`s. Replace apparent data entry errors by `NA`s.

```{r eval=F}
icu <- read_rds("/Users/julietzhou/Documents/R/HW3_Shiny/icu_cohort.rds")

# print the variables with > 5000 missing values
missing_var <- as_tibble(cbind(col_names = colnames(icu), 
                       missing = colSums(is.na(icu)) > 5000)) %>% 
  filter(missing == TRUE) %>% 
  print()

# remove these variables
icu <- icu %>% 
  select(-missing_var$col_names)
```

```{r}
# For vitals, the following measurements are replaced with NA: 

# temperature_fahrenheit < 70
# heart_rate > 800
# non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic > 10000
# non_invasive_blood_pressure_mean > 800

icu <- icu %>% 
  mutate(temperature_fahrenheit = 
           ifelse(temperature_fahrenheit < 70, 
                  NA, temperature_fahrenheit),
         heart_rate = ifelse(heart_rate > 800, NA, heart_rate),
         non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic = 
           ifelse(non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic > 10000, NA, 
                  non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic),
         non_invasive_blood_pressure_mean = 
           ifelse(non_invasive_blood_pressure_mean > 800, NA,
                  non_invasive_blood_pressure_mean))
```


4. Impute missing values by `miceRanger` (request $m=3$ datasets). This step is very computational intensive. Make sure to save the imputation results as a file.

```{r}
# demonstrate with a random sample of 1000 from the data set
set.seed(1245)
icu_sample <- icu %>% sample_n(10000) %>% 
  # only keep variables that are going to be used in Q2
  select(death_within_30days, # outcome variable
         gender, age_at_adm, marital_status, ethnicity, # demographics
         # first lab measurements
         bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, 
         potassium, sodium, hematocrit, wbc,
         # first vital measurements
         heart_rate, non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic, 
         non_invasive_blood_pressure_mean, respiratory_rate, 
         temperature_fahrenheit)

system.time(
  miceObj <- miceRanger(
    icu_sample, 
    m = 3, 
    max.depth = 10,
    returnModels = TRUE, 
    verbose = FALSE)
)

# runtime: 214.485 

dataList <- completeData(miceObj)

saveRDS(dataList, file = "/Users/julietzhou/Documents/R/HW4/miceData_n10000.rds")
```

5. Make imputation diagnostic plots and explain what they mean.
```{r}
# red: original; black: imputed values
plotDistributions(miceObj, vars = 'allNumeric')
# does not appear to converge over iterations
plotCorrelations(miceObj, vars = 'allNumeric')
# for some, there's some convergence
plotVarConvergence(miceObj,vars = 'allNumeric')
# not converging
plotModelError(miceObj,vars = 'allNumeric')

plotVarImportance(miceObj)
```
6. Obtain a complete data set by averaging the 3 imputed data sets.

```{r}
xnam <- names(icu_sample)[2:20]

fmla <- as.formula(paste("death_within_30days ~ ", paste(xnam, collapse= "+")))

dm1 <- model.matrix(fmla, data = dataList$Dataset_1)
dm2 <- model.matrix(fmla, data = dataList$Dataset_2)
dm3 <- model.matrix(fmla, data = dataList$Dataset_3)

dm_avg <- (dm1 + dm2 + dm3)/3

finaldata <- cbind(
  death_within_30days = as.numeric(dataList$Dataset_1$death_within_30days), 
  as.data.frame(dm_avg))

remove(dm1, dm2, dm3, dm_avg)
```

## Q2. Predicting 30-day mortality

Develop at least two analytic approaches for predicting the 30-day mortality of patients admitted to ICU using demographic information (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity), first lab measurements during ICU stay, and first vital measurements during ICU stay. For example, you can use (1) logistic regression (`glm()` function), (2) logistic regression with lasso penalty (glmnet package), (3) random forest (randomForest package), or (4) neural network.

1. Partition data into 80% training set and 20% test set. Stratify partitioning according the 30-day mortality status.

```{r}
set.seed(1245)
train_index <- createDataPartition(
  finaldata$death_within_30days,
  p = 0.8,
  list = FALSE)

# the following dataasets can be used directly in logistic model
icu_train <- finaldata[train_index, ]
icu_test <- finaldata[-train_index, ]

# the following steps format data for neural network
icu_train_x <- subset(icu_train, select = -death_within_30days) 
icu_train_x <- as.matrix(icu_train_x)

icu_train_y <- icu_train$death_within_30days

icu_test_x <- subset(icu_test, select = -death_within_30days) 
icu_test_x <- as.matrix(icu_test_x)

icu_test_y <- icu_test$death_within_30days
```

2. Train the models using the training set.

```{r}
# Model 1: logistic model

# fit the model
logit_model <- train(as.character(death_within_30days) ~. + 0, 
                     data = icu_train, 
                     method = "glm", 
                     family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# test the model
# get predictions for the test dataset
pred <- predict(logit_model, newdata = icu_test)
# calculate accuracy of the model
accuracy <- table(pred, icu_test[,"death_within_30days"])
sum(diag(accuracy))/sum(accuracy)
```

```{r}
# Model 2: logistic model with lasso penalty
install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)

```

```{r}
# Model 4: neural networks

nn_model <- keras_model_sequential() 
nn_model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 8, activation = 'relu', 
              input_shape = ncol(icu_train_x)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 8, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = 'sigmoid') 

nn_model %>% compile(
  loss = loss_binary_crossentropy, 
  optimizer = "adam", 
  metrics = "binary_accuracy"
)

system.time({
history_icu <- nn_model %>% fit(
  x = icu_train_x, y = icu_train_y, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)
})

plot(history_icu)

# test the model
nn_model %>% evaluate(icu_test_x, icu_test_y)
```

3. Compare model prediction performance on the test set.
